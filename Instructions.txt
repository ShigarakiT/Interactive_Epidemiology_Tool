Thank you for your interest in our tool! Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect a group 
of people. Both in the spread of the disease and the impact of the disease on the group of people.

To study how diseases spread simulations are used to model populations. SEIR is one of many models 
used to simulation a population. SEIR stands for: Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered.

Each component represents a portion of a population of people:

Susceptible - People who are at risk of being exposed to a disease
Exposed - People who have been exposed but are not showing symptoms
Infected - People who demonstrate symptoms
Recovered - People who have overcome the disease or died

The model calculates the size of each population once per day.
