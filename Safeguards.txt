There is a lot of misinformation about diseases and their prevention. We hope you take a moment to read
up on some general information about preventative measures against disease.

One of the most common misconceptions is in the process of becomming sick itself. You have been
infected with diseases more often than you think! Most instances of being exposed to disease end
before you ever develop symptoms. This is why prevention is so important, because it is a numbers
game. The more times you are exposed to a disease the more likely you are to develop symptoms.

Quarantine - 	Quarantine refers to the action of self-isolating after you display symptoms.
		Quarantining is effective in preventing the spread of disease, but can 
		only be done by people who are already sick. This means it is less effective for 
		diseases that can spread before you develop symptoms, like with COVID-19.

Vaccination   - Vaccines are a weakened or limited version of the disease that is introduced to the
	body via injection. Vaccines train the body to be able fight against the disease you
	are vaccinated for. A common misconception is that vaccines should prevent you
	from ever getting sick. Vaccines do increase the chance that you will not develop
	symptoms, but their main function is to ensure your body is ready to fight the
	disease. A person who is vaccinated will not develop the same severity of 
	symptoms as they would had they been unvaccinated.
